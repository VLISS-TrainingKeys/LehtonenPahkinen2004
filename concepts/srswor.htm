<p><font size="3" face="Arial">
This forms the basis of many other more complex sampling plans and is the 'gold standard' against which all other 
sampling plans are compared. It often happens that more complex sampling plans consist of a series of simple random 
samples that are combined in a complex fashion. 

In this design, once the frame of units has been enumerated, a sample of size n is selected without replacement from 
the N population units. Look pages 22-> in Lehtonen, R. & Pahkinen, E. (2004)
