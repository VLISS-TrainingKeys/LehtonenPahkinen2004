1) The calibration equation for an auxiliary variable z in poststratification, ratio estimation and regression estimation is 
<img border="0" src="../key106/pic/p4.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE>. This means that the HT estimator of the total of the auxiliary variable z reproduces the 
known population total of z-variable.<BR><BR>

2) To verify this, we need to calculate:<BR>

<ul>
a) Sampling weights w<SUB>k</SUB> = 1/&#960;<SUB>k</SUB><BR>
b) Adjustment weights (g-weights) g<SUB>k</SUB>, which depend on both the chosen model-assisted technique and the realized sample.Formulas for 
different g-weights are given in page 89 (poststratification), page 93 (ratio estimation) and page 98 (regression estimation).<BR>
c) Calibrated weights w<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>k</SUB>=g<SUB>k</SUB>w<SUB>k</SUB>.<BR>
</ul>

&#8226; For ratio estimation and regression estimation the calibration property is verified by showing that the total T<SUB>z</SUB> = 91753 will be reproduced.<BR>
&#8226; For poststratification the total T<SUB>z</SUB> = 7 is reproduced being the number of urban municipalities in the population.
<BR><BR>

3) For poststratification and regression estimation, you can also make additional checks:
<ul>
a) <img border="0" src="../key106/pic/p1.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE><BR>
b) <img border="0" src="../key106/pic/p2.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE><BR>
c) <img border="0" src="../key106/pic/p3.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE><BR>
</ul>
4) For ratio estimation, the check 3a) only is valid (because the regression model used in ratio estimation does not include an intercept term).
<BR><BR>
We use a SRSWOR sample (n=8) selected from the Province’91 population to verify the calibration property. The results are shown first for 
poststratification, then for ratio estimation and finally for regression estimation. In addition, model-assisted estimates of the total of UE91 
are calculated by using the calibrated weights.
