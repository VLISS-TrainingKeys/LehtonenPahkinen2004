Nonresponse</font></p>
<hr>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">We investigate the nonresponse bias in the Province’91 population in a hypotetical case by assuming that all the
southern municipalities were unable to complete in time the records for the unemployed. These municipalities are Kuhmoinen, Joutsa, Luhanka, Leivonmäki
and Toivakka. In the data set, a variable RES_POP has been included to indicate that a valid response has been received (RES_POP = 1) or has not 
received (RES_POP = 0), from a municipality. 

The population of municipalities is thus divided into two
subpopulations, the group of respondents (N_1 = 27) and the group of nonrespondents (N_2 = 5). The bias calculated under this setting 
amounts to 2057,6 which is quite large.
