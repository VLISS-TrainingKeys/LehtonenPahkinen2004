Reweighting</font></p>

<p>In this exercise, the initial sample size is eight municipalities drawn from the <i>Province'91</i> population. Let us
assume two unit nonresponse cases, namely, Kuhmoinen and Toivakka. Thus, the estimated response
rate is 0.75. Note that the value of the auxiliary variables HOU85 and URB85 are available for the nonresponse cases
also. In addition, three of the sampled municipalities are towns (response homogeneity group c = 1) and 
the other five are rural municipalities (response homogeneity group c = 2).
</p>
<p>
For calculating the reweights, we should first define the appropriate response
homogeneity groups. For the total estimators

the total sample is a natural single group. For the total estimator 
<img border="0" src="p4.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE width="31" height="37">, two response homogeneity groups 
are created according to urbanicity (URB85).
</p>
<p>
Using the calculated reweights, the estimated totals and their variance estimates
can be calculated. Estimates for the total T of UE91 are simply reweighted
HT estimators calculated for the respondent data set. We focus on the variance estimation because it now includes two
components: the variance estimator Var_sam due to the sampling design and the
variance estimator Var_rew caused by the response mechanism. We assume that
nonresponse is ignorable within each response homogeneity group.
</p>
<p>
The Var_sam component is the same for each reweighted estimator. The
reweighting component depends on the reweighting method
used. For all the reweighting methods, the estimation of Var_rew is carried out. This includes, the reweighted 
Horvitz-Thompson estimator, the response homogeneity group (RHG) method and the ratio method. A desired property of a reweighted estimator is that 
it reproduces, as closely as possible, the value of the full response estimator. In this case, both the response data estimator and the reweighted HT 
estimator give poor results. The same holds for variance estimates. The response homogeneity group estimator and the ratio estimator use auxiliary information. 
These estimators are based on more appropriate model assumptions, and if the assumptions hold closely these two estimators reproduce closely the 'Full response' estimate.
