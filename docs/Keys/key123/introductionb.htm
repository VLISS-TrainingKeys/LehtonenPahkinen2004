We impute for two missing values for the sample selected from the Province’91
population with SRSWOR. The same sample is used as in Example 4.2, and it
includes n = 8 municipalities. A missing value is created for the study variable
UE91 for two municipalities (Kuhmoinen and Toivakka). Variable HOU85 serves as
an auxiliary variable having no missing values.<BR>

<p>For this simple exercise, we
apply hot-deck imputation independently five times. Note that hot-deck imputation
 is used here just to illustrate the basic principles of multiple imputation
for this quite restricted small-scale data set. In practice, more complex imputation modes are used.</p>

For each run, a missing response is replaced by a value selected randomly
from the respondent data set. This procedure results in five complete data sets,
which are presented in the results.<BR>

A point estimate

 of the total of unemployed persons is here the mean value of the five individual datawise estimates 
<img border="0" src="p3.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE width="21" height="37"> of the same total.

The variance of the estimator 
<img border="0" src="p2.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE width="26" height="34"> is decomposed to within-imputation
variability and between-imputation variability.<BR>
Within-imputation variability:<BR>

Between-imputation variability:<BR>

The results from all imputation methods are shown in the final table of this Training Key.
