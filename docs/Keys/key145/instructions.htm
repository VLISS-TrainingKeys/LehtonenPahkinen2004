LINEARIZATION METHOD</font></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Arial" size="3">In
this part we will demonstrate how the estimation of the variance of a combined
ratio type proportion or mean estimator can be carried out with the
linearization method. The reason for the use of linearization is that the
proportion and mean estimators should be treated here as nonlinear estimators of
type y/x where both the numerator y and the denominator x are random variables.
The denominator x is random because the sampling design of the MFH Survey is a
stratified two-stage design where the cluster sample sizes are not fixed in
advance, and the subgroup size is not fixed.</font></span></p>
<p><font face="Arial Black" size="3">&nbsp;<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman">HOW
TO MANAGE THIS EXERCISE</span></font></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Arial" size="3">In
this exercise, </font></span><font face="Arial" size="3">variance approximations
are calculated using the linearization method for the proportion estimate of the
binary variable CHRON (Chronic morbidity; 1 present, 0 otherwise) and the mean
estimate of the continuous variable SYSBP (Systolic blood pressure).<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Please examine first the MFH Survey data set:
Variables and the cluster sample sums of CHRON and PHYS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You will note that the sampling design is a paired clusters design with 24 strata and two sample clusters drawn from each stratum. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Results of variance estimation by linearization
are displayed in the final box of the output pages. The variable phat&nbsp;refers
to CHRON and is the proportion estimate of chronic morbidity in 30-64 years old
males. V_des_phat is the corresponding variance approximation. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The variable yhat refers to SYSBP and is the
estimate of mean systolic blood pressure in 30-64 years old males. V_des_yhat is
the corresponding variance approximation. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">SAS code for this exercise is also available for
your further training.</font></p>
