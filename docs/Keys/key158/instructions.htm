JRR TECHNIQUE</font></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Arial" size="3">In
this part we will demonstrate how the estimation of the variance of a combined
ratio type proportion or mean estimator can be carried out with the
JRR technique. The reason for the use of JRR technique is that the
proportion and mean estimators should be treated here as nonlinear estimators of
type y/x where both the numerator y and the denominator x are random variables.
The denominator x is random because the sampling design of the MFH Survey is a
stratified two-stage design where the cluster sample sizes are not fixed in
advance, and the subgroup size is not fixed. </font></span></p>
<p><font face="Arial Black" size="3">&nbsp;<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman">HOW
TO MANAGE THIS EXERCISE</span></font></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Arial" size="3">In
this exercise, </font></span><font face="Arial" size="3">variance approximations
are calculated using the JRR technique for the proportion estimate of the
binary variable CHRON (Chronic morbidity; 1 present, 0 otherwise) and the mean
estimate of the continuous variable SYSBP (Systolic blood pressure).<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">1) Please examine first the MFH Survey data set:
Variables and the cluster sample sums of CHRON and PHYS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You will note that the sampling design is a paired clusters design with 24 strata and two sample clusters drawn from each stratum. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">2) View results from the links on the left. In the first 
table the weight matrix for forming the pseudosamples is constructed. 10 first 
weight vectors are printed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">3) In the second table, the pseudo samples have been 
constructed and the ratio estimates from the pseudosamples are calculated. 
Pseudosamples are constructed as follows. For the first pseudosample, we exclude 
the first cluster <i>h1 </i>from the first stratum and weight the second cluster
<i>h2</i> by the value 2, leaving the remaining <i>H-1 </i>data unchanged. By 
repeating this procedure for all strata, we get a total of <i>H</i> 
pseudosamples. In our example case, <i>H</i>=24. The JRR variance estimator is 
derived by using this set of pseudosamples. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">NOTE! It is possible to construct a similar set of <i>H</i> 
complement pseudosamples by changing the order of the clusters that are 
excluded. By doing so, it is possible to construct more JRR variance estimators. 
However, this part is left for the option of interactive analysis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">4) In the third table, JRR variance estimates by stratum 
are calculated from the pseudosamples. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">5) In the fourth table, the JRR variance estimate is 
displayed with its corresponding variance estimate and standard error.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">6) View the SAS MACRO to get a more clear picture 
on how JRR technique functions. </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial">7) Use the macro and modify it for your own purposes 
(option for the interactive analysis).</font></p>
