Estimation of domain totals by design-based model-asisted methods under SRSWOR sampling. We illustrate the domain estimation 
methodology of Chapter 6 by selecting different SRSWOR samples (n = 500, n=1500 and n=3000 persons) from the OHC Survey data set (N = 7841 persons) and estimating 
the total number of chronically ill persons in the D = 30 domains constructed. Finally we summarize the obtained results.
