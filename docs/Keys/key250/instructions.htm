<p align="center"><font face="Arial Black">INSTRUCTIONS FOR KEY 250 PART A: Test 
of Independence by SUDAAN/CROSSTAB</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial">In this part we will demonstrate how to carry out a test of 
independence of health hazards of work (PHYS) and psychic strain (PSYCH3)&nbsp; in the OHC Survey 
setting. The results obtained from a design-based test of independence are 
compared to those obtained from a model-based test of independence. The design-based test statistic is calculated by the SAS
callable SUDAAN procedure <A HREF="sudaancrosstab.htm" onClick="return popupa(this,'examplea')">
<u>CROSSTAB</u></a>.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial Black" size="3">&nbsp;<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman">HOW
TO MANAGE THIS EXERCISE</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">1) Please examine first the overview of the OHC 
Survey data.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">2) View results from the link on the left. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">A hypothesis of independence is stated as H<sub>0</sub>: p<sub>jk </sub>= p<sub>j+</sub>p<sub>+k</sub> 
with j=1,2 and k=1,2,3, or, analogously, H<sub>0</sub>: p<sub>11 </sub>- p<sub>1+</sub>p<sub>+1</sub>= 
0 and p<sub>12 </sub>- p<sub>1+</sub>p<sub>+2 </sub>= 0. </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial">Table 1. The Cell and Marginal proportions of variables 
PHYS and PSYCH3 are viewed. </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial">Table 2. Design-based Wald test results for table PHYS*PSYCH3 are 
viewed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Table 3. Model-based Pearson Chi-Squared test results for table PHYS*PSYCH3 are 
viewed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">NOTE: Pay attention to the following. The Design-based Wald test 
provides a reasonable testing procedure for an independence hypothesis of PHYS and 
PSYCH3 (the results in Table 2). The model-based test of independence (Table 3) 
produces too large &#967;<sup>2</sup>-values and therefore too small p-values. This is because 
the clustering effect is not accounted for the model-based &#967;<sup>2</sup>-test contrary to the design-based Wald 
test.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">3) View the SAS code for performing a comparison of 
design-based and model-based tests of independence. The code can be downloaded.</font></p>
