<p><font size="3" face="Arial"> 
The SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure investigates the relationship between discrete responses and a set of explanatory variables for survey data. The procedure fits linear logistic regression models for discrete response survey data by the method of maximum likelihood, incorporating the sample design into the analysis. The SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure enables you to use categorical classification variables (also known as CLASS variables) as explanatory variables in an explanatory model, using the familiar syntax for main effects and interactions employed in the GLM and LOGISTIC procedures.

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The following link functions are available for regression in PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC: the cumulative logit function (CLOGIT), the generalized logit function (GLOGIT), the probit function (PROBIT), and the complementary log-log function (CLOGLOG). The procedure performs maximum likelihood estimation of the regression coefficients with either the Fisher-scoring algorithm or the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Variances of the regression parameters and the odds ratios are computed with a Taylor expansion approximation; refer to Binder (1983) and Morel (1989). </font> </p>
