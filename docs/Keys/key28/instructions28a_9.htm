<p align="center"><font face="Arial Black">INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRAINING KEY 28 PART A:</font><font face="Arial Black" size="3"> 
ANALYSING AN SRS SAMPLE BY SAS/SURVEYMEANS</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In this exercise we calculate the SRSWOR 
(simple random sampling without replacement) estimates for the total of UE91(number 
of unemployed in the province) and 
LAB91 (size of labour force in the province) and 
for the RATIO UE91/LAB91 with their standard errors. We use Province'91 data set as 
the frame 
population. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In the calculation we use the SAS procedure <A HREF="../training/concepts/procsurveymeans.htm" onClick="return popupa(this,'')">
<u>SURVEYMEANS</u></a>. (Tested with SAS 9.1)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial Black">HOW TO MANAGE THIS EXERCISE</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">View the results from the menu on the left. Selected SRSWOR sample and the estimates for the total of UE91 and LAB91 and for the ratio 
UE91/LAB91 will be viewed (they are similar to the results viewed in table 2.4 
on page 29 in Lehtonen and Pahkinen 2004). Pay attention to the estimates 
and their standard errors and try to think why SRSWOR may lack any significance 
for practical purposes according to this case study. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After viewing the results, you can examine the SAS code 
used to calculate the estimates for the total of UE91 and LAB91 and for the ratio 
UE91/LAB91. Then, you may move on to next step of Key 28 in which different 
size SRSWOR samples will be selected to study how the sample size affects to the 
total estimate and to the ratio estimate. </font></p>
