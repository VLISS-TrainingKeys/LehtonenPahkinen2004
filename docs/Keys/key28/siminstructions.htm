MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TECHNIQUES</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In this part we perform Monte Carlo 
simulations to examine the behaviour of the SRSWOR estimator of 
the total. 
Descriptive statistics of the Monte 
Carlo simulations will be displayed in numerical and in graphical format. </font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial Black">HOW TO MANAGE THIS EXERCISE</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Select the sample size from the drop down 
menus on the left and press submit to view the results. The number of simulated 
samples in each simulation is 1000. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In each simulation, the population total, mean of estimates, standard error, bias, absolute relative bias 
(ARB) and root MSE (RMSE) are displayed for the estimator concerned. The 
distribution of estimates is viewed in the graph. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial Black">HOW TO INTERPRET THE RESULTS</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The mean of the distribution of the estimates is expected to coincide 
closely with the corresponding population parameter. Here, the mean of the total estimates fits well with the corresponding parameter. 
Thus, in this respect the SRSWOR estimator works well. It is design unbiased. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">On the other hand, if you take a closer 
examination to the histograms, you can see that in some of them there are two 
peaks. This cautions us against basing our inferences on an assumption of a 
normal distribution. This happens when the distribution of the study variable is 
skewed and the sample size is not large enough.Now, your task is to find what might be a SRSWOR sample size large enough 
when estimating each parameter and to decide whether SRSWOR is an appropriate 
technique for the estimation of the total of UE91 and LAB91 in the Province'91 population. </font>
