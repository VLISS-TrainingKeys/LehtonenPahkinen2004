FOR KEY 288: Logistic ANCOVA by SAS / SURVEYLOGISTIC<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In this exercise we will fit a logistic ANCOVA model in the OHC
Survey data set by SAS/SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure. The binary response variable PSYCH2 measures
psychic strain (1: present, 2: otherwise). AGE (in years), PHYS (binary;
Physical health hazards; 1 present, 0 otherwise) and CHRON (binary; Chronic
morbidity; 1 present, 0 otherwise) are treated as continuous predictors. SEX is
the discrete predictor. Thus there are four predictors available. Because SEX*AGE is statistically 
significant interaction term it is included in the model. (See Key 288 with SAS/SUDAAN RLOGIST for model specification)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Black" size="3">HOW TO MANAGE THIS EXERCISE</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">You can view the interpretation of the used model in <b>View model info</b>.
Please examine the results of the model, also the odds ratio statistics (OR)
and their standard errors are calculated. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Please compare the results with the logit ANOVA
exercise (KEY 277). What conclusions can be drawn?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>MODEL (2):<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
