<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The main goal of this exercise is to get familiar
with the role of interaction terms in design-based logistic ANCOVA modelling. In addition to
the intercept and main effect terms SEX, AGE, PHYS and CHRON, Model 1 includes
all pair-wise interactions of SEX with the continuous predictors AGE, CHRON and
PHYS: SEX*AGE, SEX*PHYS and SEX*CHRON. Please note the following points:<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">1. The examination of the p-values of the
interaction terms in the estimated coefficients table shows that there is one
interaction term that is significant at the 5 % level (the chosen reference
level): SEX*AGE (<i>p_beta </i>= 0.0062 which is significant even at the 0.01
level). The other interactions are non-significant (for SEX*PHYS <i>p_beta=</i>0.1137
and for SEX*CHRON <i>p_beta=</i>0.2805). So these terms can be removed from the
model without destroying the model fit. Thus, in addition to the intercept term,
the final reduced model will include all the main effects SEX, AGE, PHYS and
CHRON and the interaction term SEX*AGE.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">2. The role of interaction terms in a model is
demonstrated by the graphs. Fitted proportions of falling into the high psychic
strain group are calculated for each model. For Model 1 (that includes all three
interaction terms), the graphs show that the fitted proportions of falling into
high psychic strain group vary from graph to graph. The graphs are constructed
for each PHYS and CHRON combination (recall that PHYS=1 if physical health
hazards are experienced, 0 otherwise, and CHRON=1 if a given person is
chronically ill, 0 otherwise). Obviously, the variation in the levels of the
lines is due to the inclusion of all main effects in the model, and the
variation in directions of the lines is due to the inclusion of the three
interactions. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">3. Note that although graphs for Model 1 give an
adequate description of the variation in the sample data set, all the variations
cannot be generalized to the target population, this is because not all interaction
terms are statistically significant. Graphs showing variations that can be
generalized statistically will be obtained by constructing the final reduced
model.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">4. The final reduced model will be obtained from
Model 1 by removing the following interaction effects: SEX*PHYS and SEX*CHRON (since
they are not statistically significant at the reference level of 5 %).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
