<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">logit(PSYCH) = SEX + AGE + PHYS + CHRON + SEX*AGE</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In addition to the intercept and main effect
terms SEX, AGE, PHYS and CHRON, Model 2 includes the only statistically
significant (at the reference 5 % level) interaction term, that is, the term SEX*AGE.
Please note the following points:<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">1. The examination of the p-value of the
interaction term in the estimated coefficients table shows that SEX*AGE is
significant at the 5 % level (the chosen reference level): for SEX*AGE <i>p_beta</i>
= 0.0111. Thus, in addition to the intercept term, the final reduced model
includes all the main effects SEX, AGE, PHYS and CHRON and the interaction term
SEX*AGE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">2. The role of the interaction term SEX*AGE in
Model 2 is demonstrated by similar graphs as for Model 1. Fitted proportions of
falling into the high psychic strain group are calculated for Model 2. The
graphs show that for Model 2, fitted proportions of falling into upper psychic
strain group vary from graph to graph much less than for Model 1. Again, the
variation in the levels of the lines is due to the inclusion of all the main
effects in the model. Less variation in directions of the lines is due to the
inclusion of only one interaction term. Note that for males, the lines are
parallel in all graphs. This holds for females as well. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">3. Note that graphs for Model 2 give a
description of the variation that can be statistically generalized to the target
population from where the survey data has been collected. Graphs indicate (perhaps
surprisingly) that for males, prevalence of high psychic strain increases with
increasing age, and for females, prevalence decreases. Further, at a given age,
the risk of belonging to the upper strain group is larger for chronically ill
people and for people experiencing physical health hazards at work. The level is
highest when both risk factors are present. This holds for both males and
females. However, for males, the levels tend to be lower than for females, for
all ages. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">4. Odds Ratio (OR) statistics show that sex-age
adjusted OR is 1.76 for CHRON and 1.32 for PHYS.<o:p>
