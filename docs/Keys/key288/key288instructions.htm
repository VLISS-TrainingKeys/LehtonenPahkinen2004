FOR KEY 288: Logistic ANCOVA by SUDAAN/RLOGIST<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The purpose in this exercise is to demonstrate
the role of interaction terms in design-based multivariate logistic ANCOVA modelling. The OHC
Survey data set will be used. The binary response variable PSYCH2 measures
psychic strain (1: present, 2: otherwise). AGE (in years), PHYS (binary;
Physical health hazards; 1 present, 0 otherwise) and CHRON (binary; Chronic
morbidity; 1 present, 0 otherwise) are treated as continuous predictors. SEX is
the discrete predictor. Thus there are four predictors available. Because SEX is
the only discrete predictor,&nbsp;interaction terms of SEX with AGE, PHYS and
CHRON can be included in this model setting (note that we will not include
interactions formed by continuous predictors).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Black" size="3">HOW TO MANAGE THIS EXERCISE</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Please examine the different modes by selecting a
model (Model1, Model 2 or Model 3) from the <b>SELECT MODEL</b> drop-down menu.
The first model includes all the two-variable interaction terms of SEX with AGE,
PHYS and CHRON. Please examine the p-values of t-tests to determine whether an
interaction term is statistically significant. Model 2 includes one interaction
term, which appears to be statistically significant at 5 % level. Model 3
includes only the main effects. For each model, also the odds ratio statistics (OR)
and their standard errors are calculated. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">For each model, predicted proportions of PSYCH2
are calculated and presented graphically, for each PHYS-CHRON combination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Pay careful attention to these graphs, because they appear to be very
useful in interpreting the models and the role of the interaction terms. Try to
explain the results from each model. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Please compare the results with the logit ANOVA
exercise (KEY 277). What conclusions can be drawn?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>MODEL 1:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i><b>LOGIT(PSHYCH2) = INTERCEPT + SEX + AGE + PHYS + CHRON + SEX*AGE +
PHYS*SEX + CHRON*SEX</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>MODEL 2:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i><b>LOGIT(PSYCH2) = INTERCEPT + SEX + AGE + PHYS + CHRON + SEX*AGE</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>MODEL 3: </i><b>LOGIT(PSYCH2) = INTERCEPT +
SEX + AGE + PHYS + CHRON</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Guidelines for the interpretation of each model
are given in the bottom drop-down <b>INTERPRETATION HELP menu</b>.<o:p>
