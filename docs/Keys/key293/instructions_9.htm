<hr>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In this part we will demonstrate  how to 
perform design-based linear ANCOVA modelling with the WLS method for a 
continuous response in the case
of three continuous predictors, one discrete predictor and one 
interaction term. We use the design-based approach under the DES option. The data set we are using 
is the OHC Survey data set.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Black" size="3">&nbsp;<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman">HOW
TO MANAGE THIS EXERCISE</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A linear ANCOVA model is fitted on the original continuous variable 
PSYCH, whose values are scores of the first standardized principal component of 
nine psychic symptoms. Thus, the average of PSYCH is zero and the variance is 
one. We include one qualitative variable (SEX) and three continuous predictors 
(AGE, PHYS and CHRON), and also the pair-wise interaction of SEX and AGE. Thus, 
the fitted model is:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">PSYCH = Intercept + SEX + AGE + PHYS + CHRON + SEX*AGE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">1) View the overview of the OHC Survey data set from the menu on the 
left.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">2) View results.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">3) Interpret the results.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">NOTE! The signs of model coefficients and the t-test 
results follow a similar pattern to those in corresponding logistic ANCOVA model 
in TRAINING KEY 288. However, model coefficients have different interpretations from 
those in the logistic model. In a logit ANCOVA we were working on a logit scale 
on the binary response whereas we are now dealing with continuous measurements. 
Therefore the results of the linear ANCOVA model can be interpreted in the 
usual linear regression context. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">4) More tasks and exercises are given in the option for 
interactive analysis.</font></p>
