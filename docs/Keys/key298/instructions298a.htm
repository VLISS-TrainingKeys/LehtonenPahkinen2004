ACCOUNTING FOR CLUSTERING EFFECTS
FOR A CONTINOUS STUDY VARIABLE</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">The aim in this part is to compare 
empirically methods that aim at accounting for sampling design complexities: 
stratification, clustering and weighting. The main concern is in clustering 
effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">We compare empirically the methods using the 
OHC Survey dataset. We use perceived psychic strain (PSYCH) as the variable of 
interest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">The continuous variable PSYCH is</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
the first principal component of nine psychic symptoms (explaining 42 % of the 
total variation of the symptoms). The variable PSYCH is standardized for mean 
zero and variance one. Psychic strain increases with increasing the value of PSYCH. 
The overall design effect of PSYCH is about 2 indicating substantial clustering 
effect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Our main explanatory variable is CHRON 
(Chronic morbidity). Age and sex are used as additional predictors in the 
models; we calculate sex-age adjusted figures. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial">For the continuous study variable PSYCH we 
carry out further use of the SUDAAN procedure REGRESS and SAS procedure SURVEYREG. We compare the SUDAAN and SAS 
results with those given by the SAS procedures GENMOD and MIXED, and the R functions gee and lme.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial">In the previous Training Keys we have used 
SUDAAN analysis procedures to account for the clustering effects. Modeling based 
on pseudo-maximum likelihood (PML) estimation has been this far our main method. 
We now turn to certain alternative methods.</span></p>

<p><font face="Arial Black">METHODS WE DEMONSTRATE ARE THE FOLLOWING:</font><span style="font-family: Arial"><br>
<br>
- Modeling for a fixed-effects linear model based on generalized estimating 
equations (GEE) techniques with an exchangeable correlation structure, using the 
SUDAAN procedure REGRESS, the SAS procedure GENMOD and the R function gee. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial">- Linear mixed modeling based on restricted 
maximum likelihood (REML) estimation, using the SAS procedure MIXED and the R function lme. We use a simple 
model involving cluster-specific random intercepts in addition to the fixed 
effects (a variance components model).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial">In all these instances, standard errors of 
model coefficients are estimated by a robust (or empirical), “sandwich” type estimator (Lehtonen 
and Pahkinen 2004 page 271). </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial">A standard ML estimation procedure by the SAS 
procedure REG, using a model-based standard error estimate, is used as a 
reference. All sampling complexities are ignored under this option.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>NOTE!</b> In MIXED and GENMOD procedures and in R functions, 
the variable CLUSTER is transformed to a new variable SUBJECT having values 
1,2,...,250.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">GEE estimation and computation are discussed 
in Diggle, Liang and Zeger (1994) and Horton and Lipsitz (1999). Mixed, or 
multilevel, models are addressed in Goldstein (1995) and McCulloch and Searle 
(2001). Multilevel modeling is also discussed in Chapter 9 of Lehtonen and 
Pahkinen (2004).</span></p>
