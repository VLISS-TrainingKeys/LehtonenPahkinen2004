ACCOUNTING FOR CLUSTERING EFFECTS
FOR A BINARY STUDY VARIABLE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial">The aim in this part is to compare 
empirically methods that aim at accounting for sampling design complexities: 
stratification, clustering and weighting. The main concern is in clustering 
effects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial">We compare empirically the methods using the 
OHC Survey dataset. We use perceived psychic strain (PSYCH) as the variable of 
interest. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">For the binary study variable, people having 
PSYCH score greater than zero are included in the higher strain group (value 1); 
a value of zero is assigned otherwise. The overall design effect of PSYCH2 is 
1.7 indicating substantial clustering effect. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Our main explanatory variable is CHRON 
(Chronic morbidity). Age and sex are used as additional predictors in the 
models; we calculate sex-age adjusted figures. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial">For the binary study variable PSYCH2 we 
carry out further use of the SUDAAN procedure LOGISTIC (RLOGIST) and SAS procedure SURVEYLOGISTIC. We compare the 
SUDAAN and SAS results with those given by the SAS procedure GENMOD, the SAS macro GLIMMIX, 
and the R functions gee and glmmPQL.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial">In the previous Training Keys we have used 
SUDAAN analysis procedures to account for the clustering effects. Modeling based 
on pseudo-maximum likelihood (PML) estimation has been this far our main method. 
We now turn to certain alternative methods.</span></p>


<p><font face="Arial Black">METHODS WE DEMONSTRATE INCLUDE THE 
FOLLOWING:</font><span style="font-family: Arial"><br>
<br>
- Modeling for a fixed-effects logistic model based on generalized estimating 
equations (GEE) techniques with an exchangeable correlation structure, using the 
SUDAAN procedure LOGISTIC(RLOGIST), the SAS procedure GENMOD and the R function gee. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial">- Logistic mixed modeling based on 
restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation, using the SAS macro GLIMMIX and the R function glmmPQL. We use 
a simple model involving cluster-specific random intercepts in addition to the 
fixed effects (a variance components model).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial">In all these instances, standard errors of 
model coefficients are estimated by a robust (or empirical), “sandwich” type estimator 
(Lehtonen and Pahkinen 2004 page 271). </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial">A standard ML estimation procedure by the SAS 
procedure GENMOD, using a model-based standard error estimate, is used as a 
reference. All sampling complexities are ignored under this option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">Analysis options applied are the following:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>NOTE!</b> In GLIMMIX macro and GENMOD 
procedure, and in R functions, the variable CLUSTER is transformed to a new variable SUBJECT having 
values 1,2,...,250.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">GEE estimation and computation are discussed 
in Diggle, Liang and Zeger (1994) and Horton and Lipsitz (1999). Mixed, or 
multilevel, models are addressed in Goldstein (1995) and McCulloch and Searle 
(2001). Multilevel modeling is also discussed in Chapter 9 of Lehtonen and 
Pahkinen (2004).</span></p>
