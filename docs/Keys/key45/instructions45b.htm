TRAINING KEY 45 PART B:</font><font face="Arial Black" size="3">
INTRA-CLASS CORRELATION FOR SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING WHEN VARYING THE SORTING ORDER</font></p> <hr> <p
align="left"><font face="Arial">In this exercise we examine the effect of the sorting order of the population on the intra-class
correlation coefficient and the design effect DEFF. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial Black">HOW TO MANAGE THIS
EXERCISE</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">View the results from
the drop-down menu on the left. For the Province'91 population,
four separate systematic samples of eight elements (<i>q=N/n</i>=32/8=4)
are drawn from the population data set similarly as in Part A. The total of the study
variable UE91 (number of unemployed in the province) is to be
estimated.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We now examine the effect of the sorting order of the population elements on the intra-class correlation coefficient. In sorting, we use the available auxiliary information on the population. The following sorting orders are developed: </br></br>
    (a) Sorting by the variable URB85 (urbanicity in 1985), used in Part A </br>
    (b) Sorting by the variable HOU85 (the number of households in 1985) </br>
    (c) Sorting by the variable HOU85 (the number of households in 1985) and permuting </br>
    (d) Sorting in random order by using a sequence of generated random numbers. </br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The results will be discussed in the "Summary" section.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Sorting the population by one or several auxiliary variables before a systematic sample is drawn is sometimes called "implicit stratification" and is frequently used in practical application of systematic sampling.
