USED AS THE SIZE MEASURE VARIABLE</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The main goal in this exercise is to show 
the role of auxiliary information in PPS sampling. In principle, any of the continuous variables 
in the frame population could be used as a size measure variable. However, it is 
important to 
examine whether they are suitable auxiliary variables before applying them. Please pay attention to 
the following points in the output:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">1) Correlation between UE91 and HOU85:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The correlation of UE91 and HOU85 is &#961;=0.997. 
Strong positive correlation is one indicator of a good size measurement variable. In the sense 
of strong correlation, HOU85 appears to be a very suitable size measurement 
variable. However, strong correlation itself is not sufficient enough for efficient 
estimation in a PPS sample.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">2) Scatterplot of UE91 against HOU85:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">A linear trend is observed from the 
scatterplot of UE91 against HOU85. This is a first good sign. The other good 
sign is that when UE91 approaches zero, HOU85 approaches zero as well. Thus, the regression 
model UE91=&#946;*HOU85 holds approximately. These are all indicators of 
a suitable auxiliary variable.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">HOU85 provides us a sufficient auxiliary 
variable and efficient estimation in a PPS sample. As we may note from the Monte 
Carlo simulation study, PPSWOR estimator is approximately unbiased with very 
small standard error providing efficient estimation in a PPS sample. This is due to the good 
auxiliary variable.</font></p>
