Estimation under systematic PPS sampling</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In this part we will examine how to perform 
the estimation under systematic PPS sampling. A sample of eight (n=8) 
municipalities is drawn with systematic PPS sampling from the Province'91 
population such that the number of households (HOU85) is used as the size 
measure z.</p>

<p align="left"> In Province'91 population the cumulative sum of HOU85 over the population is 
91753 and under systematic PPS sampling the sampling interval would be 
q=91753/8=11469. However, the largest element 'Jyvaskyla' has the value 26881 
for the variable, which is more than twice the sampling interval. Therefore, 
the element would be drawn twice and the remaining 6 elements would be drawn from the 
remaining population elements. In this case, therefore, we first take the 
largest element 'Jyväskylä' with certainty and then draw 7 elements from the 
remaining population elements by systematic PPS sampling. Such a situation is 
commonly managed in the way described above. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial Black">HOW TO MANAGE THIS EXERCISE</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">View the results from the menu on the left 
(estimation under PPS sampling). The total estimate of UE91 and its 
corresponding variance estimate are calculated. 
PPS_SYS&nbsp; and SRSWOR estimation strategies are compared. Try to evaluate 
from the output whether HOU85 is an efficient auxiliary variable in this case 
study. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Please view the SAS code to examine how the study is 
performed.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">NOTE! The true value of UE91 is 15098.</font></p>
