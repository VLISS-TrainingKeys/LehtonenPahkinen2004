The use of alternative auxiliary information in  PPSWOR sampling</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The use of alternative auxiliary information is 
demonstrated by using different size measure variables in estimation under 
PPSWOR. We apply three different size measure variables and in 
each case we perform a Monte Carlo simulation study (1000 selected samples) to 
examine the distribution of PPSWOR estimator of the total of UE91 (number of unemployed in 
the province). The purpose is to examine the effectiveness of each size measure 
variable. The Province'91 data set is used as the frame population.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial Black">HOW TO MANAGE THIS EXERCISE</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">View the frame population data set from the 
link on the left. Select the size variable from the drop-down menu on the left 
and perform the Monte Carlo simulation (1000 simulated samples, n=8) in order to 
examine the properties of PPSWOR estimator in each situation. Correlation 
coefficient between the study variable (UE91) and auxiliary variable, 
scatterplot of UE91 against the auxiliary variable, descriptive statistics of 
the estimator (including Monte Carlo mean, Mont Carlo standard error, bias, 
ARB(absolute relative bias), RMSE (Root mean squared error) and distribution of the Monte 
Carlo estimates are viewed.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Size variables that you can select are:
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">1) HOU85 (number of households in a 
municipality)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">2) Z (artificially created variable for 
pedagogical purposes, N(500,150))</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">3) X (artificially created variable for 
pedagogical purposes, UE91 + 3000)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Please try to evaluate the usefulness of the 
size measure variables (HOU85, Z, X) in PPS sampling in this case 
study. Please try to think how the type of auxiliary information affects to 
the PPS estimates and their corresponding variance estimates. Finally, the interpretation 
help menu can be examined. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">NOTE! PPSWOR_STR estimation strategy is 
applied when HOU85 is used as the auxiliary variable. This is because the size of 
the largest element is more than twice the sampling interval and therefore the 
element would be drawn twice for each simulated sample. We handle the problem by 
stratifying the Province'91 into two strata. The largest element belongs to 
stratum 1 and the rest of the elements belong to stratum 2. The largest element is 
drawn with certainty from the stratum 1 only once, and the remaining 7 elements 
for each simulated sample are selected from the stratum 2 for each simulated 
sample. The problem does not arise when Z or X are used as auxiliary variables. 
In these cases PPSWOR estimation strategy is applied without stratification. </font></p>
