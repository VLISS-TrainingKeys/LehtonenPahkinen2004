<p align="center"><font face="Arial">INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS WHEN <b>X</b> IS USED AS 
A SIZE MEASUREMENT VARIABLE</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">X is an artificially created variable for 
pedagogical purposes. Variable X is defined as UE91 + 3000. While variable X is 
used as the size measurement variable, some problems occur. Please pay attention 
to the following points in the output:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">1) Correlation between UE91 and X:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The correlation of UE91 and X is &#961;=1. 
The correlation is perfect and strong positive correlation is one indicator of a good size measurement 
variable. However, as we noted before, strong correlation is not sufficient 
enough itself for efficient estimation in a PPS sample. In the sense of a strong 
correlation, X is a perfect auxiliary variable for this case study. However, the 
problems occur once we view the scatterplot of UE91 against X.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">2) Scatterplot of UE91 against X:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">There is a perfect linear trend observed from the 
scatterplot of UE91 against Y. This is due to the correlation which is 1.&nbsp; This means that the regression UE91=&#945; + &#946;*X 
holds perfectly. The problems lies in the fact that &#945; is large and using the 
usual interpretation of regression coefficients, it can be shown that if &#945; is 
large, i.e. the regression line is intercepts the Y axis far from the origin, 
then SRSWOR can be more efficient than PPS. In this case &#945; is not extremely large but 
large enough to cause problems.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">By performing the Monte Carlo simulation 
study, we note that although PPSWOR estimator is approximately unbiased, 
standard error becomes quite large. This means a lack of accuracy in 
estimation in a PPS sample when this type of auxiliary variable is used.</font></p>
