A SIZE MEASURE VARIABLE</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Z is an artificially created variable for 
pedagogical purposes. Variable Z has the mean  500</font>
<font face="Arial">with variance  150. While variable Z is used as the size 
measurement variable, some problems occur. Please pay attention to the following 
points in the output:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">1) Correlation between UE91 and Z:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The correlation of UE91 and Z is &#961;= -0.008. 
Strong positive correlation is one indicator of a good size measurement 
variable. However, Z doesn't correlate with UE91 at all. In the sense of strong 
correlation, Z appears to be a weak size measurement variable. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">2) Scatterplot of UE91 against Z:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">There is no linear trend observed from the 
scatterplot of UE91 against Z. This is due to the correlation which is close to 
zero.&nbsp; This means that the regression UE91=&#945; + &#946;*Z does not hold well. 
This is also an indicator of a non-suitable auxiliary variable.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">By performing the Monte Carlo simulation 
study, we note that although PPSWOR estimator is approximately unbiased, 
standard error is very large. By using non-suitable size measurement variable, 
such as Z, the situation may become even worse than with a SRSWOR estimator. Z is 
not a sufficient auxiliary variable for efficient estimation in a PPS sample in 
this case study. </font></p>
